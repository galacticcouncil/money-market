# Queue Fills — implementation plan

Third-party early-exit for queued redemptions: a filler pays a queued
redeemer HOLLAR now and takes over their queue entry, inheriting its FIFO
priority. The exiter gets paid immediately at their own asking price; the
filler earns the discount for waiting out the remaining queue time (while
the escrowed shares keep accruing — settlement rate-locks at fulfillment,
so a queue spot is never yield-dead).

> **DECIDED (2026-07-20): Variant B — strict-FIFO early settlement with
> partial fills — is the design.** See §9 here for rationale and
> `QUEUE-FILLS-SPEC.md` for the buildable spec. §1–§5 describe Variant A

**Status: post-mainnet-launch feature. Explicitly NOT in the launch scope.**
The launch ships queue + stableswap only; this is an upgrade once the vault
has real usage. Rationale: it touches the escrow/claim area where audit
finding H-01 lived, and there is no filler ecosystem at launch TVL anyway.

Why it beats the stablepool for this job: the pool's convex curve makes
large instant exits expensive (measured on lark: 200K one-way flow → 7.8%
marginal discount at amp 50), while a fill is flat-priced at any size. And
a pool buyer must `requestRedeem` at the back of the queue, whereas a
filler inherits the entry's position near the head — shorter capital
lockup → tighter viable discounts → cheaper exits for everyone.

## 1. Design summary — whole-entry buyout, registry-only change

The single most important property: **a fill never touches vault
accounting.** No hDCL moves (it stays escrowed in the vault), `idleHollar`
/ `totalReservedHollar` / `totalQueuedBil` / `exchangeRate()` are all
unchanged. The vault only (a) reassigns `Request.user` and (b) forwards
the filler's HOLLAR payment to the old controller. H-01/H-02 defenses,
the maturity heap, and settlement logic are untouched.

Mechanics:

- The controller lists their request by setting an **ask discount** (bps).
  Limit-order semantics — no oracle-driven pricing, no auction. v2 can add
  a wait-time-indexed curve; v1 keeps price discovery with the seller.
- `fulfillRequest(requestId, maxHollarIn)` — anyone. Price, computed at
  fill time from current entry state:

  ```
  pending  = bilAmount − bilSettled
  price    = hollarOwed                                   // settled: face value, riskless
           + pending × exchangeRate() × (1 − askBps/1e4)  // pending: discounted
  ```

  The settled slice is bought at face (it is already fixed HOLLAR — zero
  risk), which avoids splitting the entry. One entry, one owner, always.
  `exchangeRate()` is internal NAV, not spot — not moveable by pool trades.
- Effects: pay `price` HOLLAR filler → old controller (direct
  `safeTransferFrom`, never enters vault balances); `request.user = filler`;
  clear the ask; if `bilSettled > 0`, push `requestId` into
  `settledByController[filler]` (the old controller's index entry goes
  stale and is lazily evicted by the existing swap-pop in
  `QueueLib.claimByShares` — that path already tolerates stale ids).

## 2. Contract changes

### BILVault.sol

Storage (append before `__gap`, decrement gap 47 → 45):

```solidity
/// requestId → ask discount in bps, offset by +1 (0 = not listed).
mapping(uint256 => uint32) internal fillAskPlusOne;
/// Global kill switch, admin-set. Ships disabled.
bool public fillsEnabled;
```

New functions:

- `setFillAsk(uint256 requestId, uint32 askBps)` — controller or
  `isOperator[controller][msg.sender]` (same auth shape as `cancelRedeem`,
  BILVault.sol:596). `askBps ≤ MAX_FILL_ASK_BPS` (2_000 = 20%, constant —
  fat-finger guard). `askBps == type(uint32).max` sentinel to delist, or a
  separate `clearFillAsk`. Requires pending portion > 0.
- `fulfillRequest(uint256 requestId, uint256 maxHollarIn)` —
  `nonReentrant whenNotPaused`. Checks: `fillsEnabled`, entry listed,
  `request.user != address(0)`, computed `price ≤ maxHollarIn` (races with
  cancel/settlement change the price — see §4). Effects before
  interaction; payment last. Emits `RequestFilled`.
- Admin: `setFillsEnabled(bool)` — `onlyAdminOrGuardian` off,
  `ADMIN_ROLE` on (mirrors the pause conventions at BILVault.sol:1295).

Events / errors:

```solidity
event FillAskSet(uint256 indexed requestId, address indexed controller, uint32 askBps);
event RequestFilled(uint256 indexed requestId, address indexed oldController,
                    address indexed filler, uint256 hollarPaid,
                    uint256 bilPending, uint256 bilSettled);
error FillsDisabled(); error NotListed(); error AskTooHigh(); error PriceAboveMax();
```

### QueueLib.sol

`transferRequest(queue, settledByController, requestId, newController)` —
the reassignment + settled-index bookkeeping lives next to the claim code
that consumes it. Vault stays under EIP-170 (same DELEGATECALL split
reason the library exists, see garden spec §"QueueLib").

### What deliberately does NOT change

- `requestRedeem` / `cancelRedeem` / `redeem` / `withdraw` / settlement /
  `pokeQueue` / `totalAssets()` — byte-for-byte untouched.
- The auto-claim flag is per-controller (BILVault.sol:196), not per-entry —
  nothing to migrate on fill; the filler manages their own flag.
- ERC-7540 note: the spec leaves request transferability as an extension.
  `RequestFilled` is our extension event; document that `RedeemRequest`'s
  original controller is superseded by the latest `RequestFilled`.

## 3. Authorization & payment rules

| Action | Who | Payment goes to |
|---|---|---|
| `setFillAsk` | controller or ERC-7540 operator | — |
| `fulfillRequest` | anyone (incl. self — harmless no-op economically) | always the **controller** (like `cancelRedeem`'s refund rule — operators can list but never redirect the proceeds) |
| after fill: `cancelRedeem`, ask re-list, claim | new controller (filler) | filler |

## 4. Edge cases & races

1. **Fill vs cancel** — cancel shrinks/deletes the entry first → fill sees
   `pending == 0` / unlisted and reverts. Reverse order: filled entry's
   old controller can no longer cancel (auth is against `request.user`). ✓
2. **Fill vs settlement** — `pokeQueue` settles a slice between listing
   and fill: pending→settled moves that slice from discounted to face
   pricing, total price rises. `maxHollarIn` is the filler's slippage
   guard; recomputing at execution keeps it exact.
3. **Partial-settle after fill** — future settlements push the id into
   `settledByController[filler]` (existing code paths, since `user` is now
   the filler). Verify no duplicate-push assumptions — the claim walk
   already tolerates duplicates via the stale-eviction swap-pop
   (QueueLib.sol:473).
4. **Re-listing** — filler can set their own ask and be bought out again.
   Chained fills are fine; each clears the previous ask.
5. **Dust** — whole-entry buyout means no entry splitting, so
   `minRedeemAmount` invariants can't be violated by fills.
6. **Pause semantics** — `whenNotPaused` on fills (consistent with
   claims); `fillsEnabled` kill switch independent of pause.
7. **Reentrancy** — HOLLAR (GHO) has no transfer hooks; belt-and-braces:
   `nonReentrant`, all state written before `safeTransferFrom`.

## 5. Invariants (must hold before == after any fill)

- `exchangeRate()`, `totalAssets()`, `idleHollar`, `totalReservedHollar`,
  `totalQueuedBil`, vault hDCL escrow balance, `queueHead`/`queueTail`.
- `bilAmount/bilSettled/hollarOwed` of the filled entry — only `user`
  changes.
- Sum over `settledByController` of live settled shares per controller
  matches entries' `bilSettled` (modulo lazily-evicted stale ids).

## 6. Off-chain work

- **Keeper** (`bil-vault/keeper/`): optional `filler` module — treasury
  as first market-maker: watch `FillAskSet`, fill anything with
  `askBps ≥ minProfitBps` given estimated wait (reuses
  `getEstimatedWaitTime`). Config-gated, off by default.
- **UI** (`hydration-ui` bil module): per-row "Sell your spot" on
  `WithdrawalsCard` (set/clear ask, show live fill price next to the
  existing queue-vs-instant comparison); row state "Filled — paid early"
  from `RequestFilled` (indexer). Buyer-side UI deferred — v1 buyers are
  bots/treasury. Third exit option in the withdraw modal comparison:
  queue (full NAV, wait) / instant pool (spot discount, now) / listed fill
  (your ask, when taken).
- **Indexer**: `FillAskSet` + `RequestFilled` into the redemption-history
  feed (`useRedemptionHistory` keys rows by requestId — needs the
  controller-change join).

## 7. Testing

- **Unit (foundry, `bil-vault/test/`)**: happy path unsettled / partially
  settled / fully settled; price math incl. ask bounds and the +1 offset;
  auth matrix (controller / operator / stranger / role holders); races §4
  as explicit sequences; kill switch; pause.
- **Invariant/fuzz**: extend the existing invariant suite with
  `fulfillRequest` in the action set; assert §5 invariants; fuzz
  interleavings of settle/cancel/fill/claim on the same entry.
- **Fork rehearsal**: chopsticks fork of 0.lark → upgrade → list a real
  queued request → fill from a second account → claim as filler after
  maturity settlement. Then the same on 0.lark itself via ref.
- **e2e**: UI flow on the lark preview against the upgraded vault.

## 8. Rollout

1. Implement + tests (contract work is small; the test surface is the work).
2. **Audit addendum** — mandatory, not optional: same reviewers who did
   H-01/H-02, scoped to QueueLib claim-index handling + the new surface.
3. Deploy new `QueueLib` + vault impl; governance `upgradeTo`
   (UPGRADER_ROLE is governance, UUPS, instant — no timelock).
4. Rehearse the upgrade ref on a chopsticks fork of 0.lark, then enact on
   0.lark, e2e there.
5. Mainnet upgrade ref, `fillsEnabled = false` initially; enable by
   separate admin action once the keeper/indexer/UI pieces are live.

## 9. Variant B — strict-FIFO early settlement (recommended v1)

Variant A (§1–§5, "spot transfer") leaves *settlement* strictly FIFO but
makes *liquidity timing* a market: fillers cherry-pick entries, so a
later requester can be paid before an earlier one. If the product norm is
"whoever has waited longest has first claim on any early liquidity",
there is a strictly-FIFO alternative — and it turns out to be simpler,
not harder.

### Mechanics

The filler doesn't buy a queue *spot* — they buy the queued *BIL*, in
queue order. External HOLLAR walks the queue from the head exactly like
settlement does, paying opted-in exiters at their asks; filled entries
leave the queue and the filler receives the escrowed hDCL:

```solidity
/// Walk from queueHead. For each active entry that is listed with
/// ask ≤ maxAskBps: pay controller pendingBil × rate × (1 − ask),
/// receive the pending escrowed shares, remove entry from queue.
/// When the remaining budget doesn't cover the next fillable entry,
/// fill it PARTIALLY and stop — same arithmetic as partial settlement
/// (QueueLib.sol:421): shares = budget × wad / (rate × (1 − ask))
/// rounded down, payment derived from shares (truncation residue stays
/// with the filler), `if (shares == 0) break` dust guard. Unlisted /
/// over-ask entries are skipped (counted against maxSkips like
/// settlement holes).
function fillQueue(uint256 maxHollarIn, uint32 maxAskBps)
    external nonReentrant whenNotPaused
    returns (uint256 hollarSpent, uint256 bilReceived);
```

### Partial fills — the whale answer

Variant A had to reject partial fills (§10): buying part of a *spot*
splits an entry into two owners. Variant B has no such problem — a
partial fill just shrinks the entry's pending portion in place
(`bilAmount −= sharesFilled`, `totalQueuedBil −= sharesFilled`), single
owner throughout, entry stays at the cursor. That is *structurally
identical to partial settlement*, which the queue already does on every
underfunded `pokeQueue` — same rounding rules, same dust guard, same
"entry remains until more HOLLAR arrives" semantics. Settled slices are
unaffected as before.

This closes the whale gap in B:

- A 500K entry no longer needs a single 500K filler — it drains against
  **aggregate** market capacity: ten 50K fillers over a week each take a
  slice at the whale's ask. The whale streams liquidity instead of
  waiting for one counterparty.
- Interleaving is safe by construction: partial fill → partial settle →
  partial fill on the same entry compose, because both operate on the
  same `pending = bilAmount − bilSettled` and never touch each other's
  slices. Cancel of the remainder keeps working (`cancelRedeem` refunds
  whatever pending is left).
- A sub-`minRedeemAmount` pending remainder after a partial fill is
  acceptable for the same reason it is after partial settlement:
  `minRedeemAmount` gates request creation, not queue residency, and the
  tail gets cleaned up by the next settle or fill. No dust rule needed.

Per entry, the effects are `cancelRedeem`'s (BILVault.sol:596) with two
substitutions: the pending shares go to the **filler** instead of back to
the controller, and the controller receives the filler's HOLLAR. Settled
slices (`bilSettled`/`hollarOwed`) are untouched — they stay claimable by
the original controller, so **no controller reassignment exists at all**:
no `settledByController` index migration, no face-value purchase of
settled slices, none of §4.3's duplicate-push concerns. The walk itself
mirrors `QueueLib.processQueue` (QueueLib.sol:336) — same cursor/hole-skip
/iteration-cap scaffolding, same head-compaction rules.

Accounting: `totalQueuedBil` decreases and entries delete/shrink — the
existing audited cancel semantics. `exchangeRate()`/`totalAssets()`
unchanged (shares transfer, nothing burns; the payment never enters vault
balances). Call `_syncBeforeRateSensitiveAction` before pricing, same as
every other rate consumer.

### Why skip, not stop, at non-sellers

Strictly stopping at the first unlisted entry hands a veto to whoever is
at the head: a 1-BIL entry that refuses to list would block early
liquidity for a 500K entry behind it forever. Skipping preserves the
real invariant — *among exiters willing to sell at the market's price,
earlier requests are always paid first* — while making non-participation
self-exclusion rather than griefing. Same argument for skipping asks
above the filler's `maxAskBps`: an aggressive ask only prices its own
entry out, never gates the queue behind it.

### Emergent properties

- **Fills shorten the queue for everyone.** Filled entries leave the
  queue, so everyone behind moves up — `getEstimatedWaitTime` improves,
  which shrinks the discount future sellers need. Fills are a public
  good here; in Variant A they're neutral.
- **Whale demand pays small sellers first.** A filler reaching for a
  large attractive ask deep in the queue must clear every cheaper listed
  ask ahead of it — small early exiters get paid as a side effect.
- **The filler is a BIL buyer, not a queue arbitrageur.** They end up
  holding BIL at NAV-minus-ask with no size impact — strictly better
  than buying through the pool's convex curve. Natural demand is anyone
  who wants BIL exposure at scale (incl. the treasury bot), not just
  exit-flow speculators. They inherit no priority; if they later want
  out, they queue at the back or use the pool like any holder.

### Trade-offs vs Variant A

| | A — spot transfer | B — strict-FIFO early settlement |
|---|---|---|
| Payment order | market (cherry-pick) | FIFO among sellers |
| Others' wait | unchanged | shortened |
| Whale in back | served directly, needs one big filler | after listed asks ahead clear (which the filler buys, not burns — they wanted BIL anyway); drains against aggregate demand via partial fills |
| Filler gets | queue spot near head | BIL (no priority) |
| Viable discounts | tightest (short lockup) | ask must beat "just buy & hold BIL" |
| Contract diff | controller reassignment + settled-slice purchase + index migration | cancel-with-different-destination + head walk |
| ERC-7540 | transferable-request extension | none needed (entries just exit early) |
| §4 races | 3 interactions to reason about | fill vs settle/cancel only; no settled-slice cases |

The §2–§5 sections above carry over with these deltas: storage is the
same `fillAskPlusOne` mapping + `fillsEnabled`; `setFillAsk` unchanged;
`fulfillRequest(requestId, ...)` is replaced by `fillQueue(maxHollarIn,
maxAskBps)`; the §5 invariants swap "totalQueuedBil unchanged" for
"totalQueuedBil decreases by exactly the pending shares transferred, and
vault escrow balance decreases by the same".

### Decision

**B with partial fills is v1** (decided 2026-07-20). It answers the
fairness question by construction, is a smaller and more familiar diff
(cancel semantics + settlement-walk scaffolding, both existing audited
surface), serves the realistic buyer (someone who wants BIL at size
without pool impact), and partial fills close the whale gap by letting
large entries drain against aggregate demand. Buildable spec:
`QUEUE-FILLS-SPEC.md`. Revisit A *only* if practice shows demand for
targeted mid-queue fills that strip-clearing doesn't satisfy — the
storage and listing surface are shared, so A layers on later without
migration.

## 10. Out of scope (v2 candidates)

- Auction / wait-time-curve pricing (v1 is seller-set limit orders).
- Public buyer-side order-book UI.
- Partial fills **of Variant A spots** — rejected: buying part of a spot
  splits an entry into two owners. (Variant B's partial fills have no
  such problem and are in scope — see §9.)
- Composability wrapper (tokenized queue positions) — explicitly against
  the product principle that users never touch NFTs/positions.
