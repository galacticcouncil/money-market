  Propeller `CollateralVault` — Aave-wired variant. Demonstrates the cross-contract / external-call
  path: `deposit` mints shares 1:1 (effects), then **supplies the collateral to Aave and borrows
  HOLLAR against it** (interactions) — Solidity runtime step 2 ("Vault → Aave: supply ETH, then
  borrow HOLLAR ≤74% LTV").

  `IPool.supply` / `IPool.borrow` are typed-interface ECMs → each lowers to a real EVM `call` with the
  method selector. They are **sound by assumption** on Aave's spec (the trust boundary; compile with
  `--deny-low-level-mechanics` + `--trust-report`).

  NOTES / caveats (see bridge/AAVE_ECM_DIAGNOSIS.md):
  * Aave's real `supply`/`borrow` are `void`. They are declared here with **no `returns` clause**, so
    each lowers to the no-output `externalCallNoReturn` ECM: a selector+args `call(...)` that bubbles
    failure returndata but performs **no `returndatasize` check** and decodes no return value — exactly
    what a void callee (empty returndata) needs. `repay`/`withdraw` keep `returns (Uint256)`.
  * `referralCode` is `Uint16` (Aave V3), so all six emitted selectors match mainnet exactly (supply
    0x617ba037, borrow 0xa415bcad, …); calldata is byte-identical to a live Aave call.
  * Effects precede both external calls: Checks-Effects-Interactions, enforced by Verity's codegen.
