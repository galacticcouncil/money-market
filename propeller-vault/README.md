# propeller-vault

**Research checkpoint, not a release candidate.** Start with the
[current status and resource index](docs/README.md). The principal-protection
statements below describe the intended policy under stated configuration and
maintenance assumptions, not an unconditional guarantee from the current code.
Main-interest servicing, production adapter verification and calibrated
liquidity limits remain release blockers.

Solidity contracts for **Propeller** — a protocol-managed leveraged-yield product on
Hydration. Deposit a volatile collateral (ETH, tBTC, DOT…), keep full 1× price
exposure, earn more of that same asset, and never have the principal liquidated.

Full design + chain-verified spec: `garden` wiki → `note-propeller-impl`; machine-checked
invariants live in `formal/` (Lean 4 — see `formal/README.md`).

## Architecture (Architecture A — collateral on Aave + synthetic floor + shared PRIME loop)

```
per collateral asset:
  CollateralVault (ERC4626-ish, UUPS)      "deposit ETH -> pETH shares; redeem -> ETH + yield"
    ├─ supplies collateral to the Aave money market (Main position)
    ├─ borrows HOLLAR against it at the reserve's live max LTV (re-levered on rebalance())
    ├─ mints + supplies SyntheticToken (= HOLLAR debt · buffer) -> Main HF floored, principal
    │   un-liquidatable at ANY collateral price (see formal/ floor theorems)
    └─ routes 100% of the borrowed HOLLAR ──────────┐
                                                     ▼
  SubLoop (single instance, SHARED across every CollateralVault/collateral)
    ├─ leveraged PRIME position in Aave isolation mode, self-ramped to targetHf (~1.05)
    │   via permissionless pokeBorrow (borrow HOLLAR -> router-sell -> supply aPRIME)
    ├─ every vault owns loop *shares*, priced off the loop's live NAV (no swap seam here —
    │   HOLLAR<->aPRIME goes straight through pallet_route::sell via the 0x0401 precompile)
    ├─ async, gradual unwind: requestUnwind() records a target; pokeRepay() grinds it down
    │   tranche-by-tranche (sell aPRIME -> repay loop debt -> credit freed HOLLAR to the vault)
    └─ harvest() skims equity above cost basis (surplus PRIME) -> Harvester

  Harvester        permissionless entrypoints: harvest() (skim + pro-rata compound),
                   deLever() (trip the loop's safety de-lever when HF <= trigger)
  SyntheticToken   Propeller-owned ERC20 (18dp, $1-pegged); mint/burn gated to vaults;
                   registered as an Aave reserve with LTV 0 / LT ~98% / no borrow power
```

All keeper-style operations (`pokeBorrow`, `pokeRepay`, `pokeSettle`, `harvest`, `rebalance`,
`maintainPeg`, `deLever`) are **permissionless** — each is bounded (tranche-capped, HF-guarded,
oracle-fair minOut) so a caller can only advance protocol state, never extract value. No
`KEEPER_ROLE` exists; a bot calls them for gas-cost reasons only, not authorization.

## How a user earns yield — end to end

This is the full lifecycle for one depositor, concretely, from `deposit` to `claim`.

### 1. Deposit — open a floored, leveraged position

`CollateralVault.deposit(assets, receiver)` for, say, 1 ETH at $2,000 (Aave ETH reserve:
LTV 75% / LT 85%, per the verified mainnet anchors below):

1. **Supply**: the vault deposits your 1 ETH into the Aave money market (the vault's own
   "Main" Aave account — one shared account per `CollateralVault`, not per user). You get
   `pETH` shares minted 1:1 with `assets` pre-yield (`convertToShares`, ERC4626-style).
2. **Borrow HOLLAR**: the vault borrows HOLLAR against *only the collateral delta this
   deposit just added* (not the whole account — sizing off the total would over-borrow on
   top of an existing position, see Aave error 36 guard), at the reserve's live max LTV.
   For 1 ETH @ 75% LTV that's ~1,500 HOLLAR (bps precision, read live off
   `pool.getConfiguration`, never cached).
3. **Mint the synthetic floor**: the vault mints `SyntheticToken` sized so
   `synth · ltSynth ≥ mainDebt · 1.005` (a 0.5% buffer) and supplies it into the *same* Main
   Aave account. Because the synthetic's liquidation threshold (~98%) alone covers the HOLLAR
   debt, **the Main position's health factor is floored above 1 independent of the ETH
   price** — even at ETH → $0, this account cannot be liquidated. (Proved for all prices
   ≥ 0 in `formal/PropellerLean/Spec/Floor.lean::never_liquidated_at_any_price`.) This is
   the mechanism behind "keep full 1× ETH exposure, never liquidated" — the leverage risk is
   entirely walled off into the shared loop, not the user's Main position.
4. **Deploy into the shared loop**: the full ~1,500 HOLLAR borrowed is transferred into the
   single shared `SubLoop.deposit()`, which mints this vault loop *shares* priced at the
   loop's current NAV (first depositor gets 1 share/HOLLAR; later depositors dilute against
   accrued equity — same non-manipulable share-price pattern as the outer vault).

At this point your 1 ETH sits in Aave earning nothing extra directly — the yield engine is
entirely inside the shared loop your borrowed HOLLAR just seeded.

### 2. The shared loop — where the yield actually comes from

`SubLoop` runs **one leveraged PRIME position** shared by every `CollateralVault`, regardless
of collateral asset (ETH- and tBTC-seeded HOLLAR sit in the same loop). It is not a swap-and-
hold: it self-levers PRIME's own Aave supply APY.

- **`pokeBorrow()`** (permissionless, called repeatedly by a bot): borrows HOLLAR against the
  loop's current aPRIME collateral, capped so HF never dips below `deployHfFloor`, then
  immediately router-sells that HOLLAR → PRIME → supplies it as `aPRIME` in the same
  transaction (`pallet_route::sell`, oracle-fair min-out — not pool spot, so it resists
  manipulation). Repeated calls ramp the position up to `targetHf` (~1.05), at which point
  borrowing power is exhausted and the ramp stops on its own.
- Net effect: PRIME's base lending yield is leveraged roughly `1 / (1 - 1/targetHf)` ≈ several
  ×, funded entirely by borrowed HOLLAR that traces back to every vault's deposit — this is
  the "loop."
- **`maintainPeg()` / `rebalance()`** keep the Main-side floor and LTV correct as HOLLAR debt
  accrues interest and as ETH price moves (re-lever up when the collateral appreciates so
  yield notional tracks its value; de-lever the loop slice down when it falls).

### 3. Harvest — surplus PRIME becomes more of *your* collateral

The loop's total equity (`totalEquity()`, Aave account value) grows over time as PRIME's
supply APY accrues, pushing it above `principalEquity` (the HOLLAR cost basis every vault
seeded). Anyone can call:

- **`SubLoop.harvest()`**: computes `surplus = totalEquity - principalEquity - unwindTargetEquity`
  (in-flight redemptions are explicitly excluded — they're not carry, see
  `FUTURE_IMPROVEMENTS.md` bug G), gated by a minimum threshold so dust doesn't get skimmed,
  withdraws that surplus as **PRIME** (never touching principal — HF stays at target), and
  sends it to the registered `Harvester`.
- **`Harvester.harvest(minOuts[])`**: splits the PRIME surplus **pro-rata by each vault's loop
  shares** and calls `compound(PRIME, cut, minOut, route)` on every registered vault in turn.
  A registry-completeness check (`registeredShares == totalShares`) fails loudly rather than
  silently stranding a vault's cut.
- **`CollateralVault.compound()`**: swaps its PRIME cut into *that vault's own collateral*
  (ETH for the ETH vault, tBTC for the tBTC vault — never cross-contaminated) at an
  oracle-fair floor (controller `quoteCollateral`, AaveOracle-priced, so even a malicious caller-
  supplied route/minOut can only tighten the fill, never worsen it). It measures actual
  collateral receipts, accrues the vault's protocol fee (initially **5%**) in a separate
  controller, then **supplies the remainder into the Main Aave position**.

Governance configures fees independently per vault. Anyone can trigger payment of accrued
underlying collateral to the current treasury recipient. Fees apply after swaps and before
Main borrowing interest; direct caller-funded compound contributions are untaxed.
See [protocol fee policy, wiring and claims](docs/protocol-fees.md).

Since `totalAssets() == collateralAToken.balanceOf(vault) + collateral.balanceOf(vault)` and `exchangeRate() =
totalAssets/totalSupply`, growing the aToken balance **without minting new shares** directly
raises the ETH-per-pETH-share price. This is the entire "deposit ETH, earn more ETH"
mechanism — depositors never receive PRIME, HOLLAR, or any token but their own collateral;
the swap happens once, inside `compound`, on their behalf.

**No user action required at either step, and compounding auto-reinvests into more yield —
not just idle balance.** `compound()` itself only supplies the swapped-in ETH — it does not
borrow more HOLLAR or grow the loop in the same call. But that extra ETH raises the vault's
collateral value, which is exactly what `rebalance()` (§ above, permissionless, called by a
bot — never the user) watches for: once compounding (or price appreciation) has widened the
gap between the vault's current LTV and the reserve's live max LTV past the 500bps band,
`rebalance()` borrows more HOLLAR against the *new, larger* collateral base, mints the
matching synthetic, and deploys that HOLLAR into the shared loop (`subLoop.deposit`) — growing
the position's loop shares, and with them its slice of every future harvest. So a deposit left
untouched compounds in two stages, both bot-driven and neither requiring the depositor to lift
a finger: **harvest → compound()** lifts the share price immediately, and the next
**rebalance()** re-levers the now-larger collateral base back into the loop, so subsequent
harvests are skimmed off a bigger position. The user never re-deposits, re-stakes, or claims
anything until they choose to redeem.

### 4. Redeem — cashing out at the appreciated share price

`requestRedeem(shares, owner)` is async (ERC-7540-style), because unwinding the shared loop
takes gradual, HF-safe tranches:

1. The vault snapshots this request's **proportional slice** of the Main position at request
   time: `collateralOwed`, `debtShare` (Main HOLLAR debt), `synthShare`, and `loopSlice`
   (shares in the shared loop) — all `shares / totalSupply` of the current totals, so
   settlement is deterministic regardless of what happens afterward.
2. The vault calls `SubLoop.requestUnwind(loopSlice)`, which converts the share slice to an
   equity target (HOLLAR) and registers it; the vault's own loop shares are burned
   immediately (they no longer earn future harvests).
3. `SubLoop.pokeRepay()` (permissionless, gradual) grinds the unwind down: each call sells an
   HF-safe sliver of aPRIME → HOLLAR via the router, repays loop debt with it, and credits
   the freed equity **pro-rata across all open unwind requests** (`_creditFreed` — weighted by
   remaining-to-credit, not raw requested, which is exactly the bug-G fix: weighting by the
   raw request number over-credits once any round free-without-pulls).
4. `CollateralVault.pokeSettle()` pulls its share of freed HOLLAR from the loop
   (`pullFreed()`), repays the corresponding slice of Main HOLLAR debt, releases + burns the
   matching synthetic, and withdraws the matching ETH from Aave — marking the request
   claimable. This can span several calls as the unwind grinds down (FIFO across the queue).
5. **`claim(requestId, receiver)`** pays out `collateralOwed` in ETH. Because compounded
   harvests raised `totalAssets()` between deposit and redemption without diluting your
   shares, `collateralOwed` for the same share count is now **more ETH than you deposited** —
   that's the realized yield, paid entirely in the asset you put in.

## Status: core flows and test coverage

`forge test` covers the core flows, borrowing discount, protocol fees and a six-property
invariant suite over `Handler.sol`. `MockPool` models Aave accounting, and `MockDispatch`
simulates router execution with SCALE encodings pinned against runtime metadata. These
are mock integrations, not execution of the native Substrate runtime.

Optional pinned forks exercise deployed HOLLAR debt and Aave supply code with explicitly
controlled inputs. See [fee validation limits](docs/protocol-fees.md). Existing formal
artifacts do not prove the newly added fee implementation.

**Mainnet readiness** — see `AUDIT.md` (living finding ledger), `DEPLOYMENT.md` (runbook),
`deployments/` (address registry), `x-ray/` (pre-audit report) and
`../PROPELLER-MAINNET-HANDOVER.md` (what has already gone wrong). Production activation
requires independent review, resolution of applicable audit findings, and a full native
asset/DEX deployment rehearsal. Adding fees and discounts does not resolve those blockers.

- **deposit** → Main leg (supply collateral → borrow HOLLAR → mint+supply synthetic → seed
  the shared loop)
- **synthetic flooring** → Main HF stays ≥ 1 at −99% ETH and at ETH≈$0 (a bare position would
  be liquidated at the same price) — machine-checked for *all* prices in `formal/`
- **deploy ramp** → `pokeBorrow` self-ramps the shared loop to `targetHf` ≈ 1.05
- **unwind** → the deleveraging spiral (`pokeRepay`) drains a requested slice and frees the
  seed equity back, HF-safe throughout, pro-rata credited across concurrent unwinders
- **full withdraw** → `requestRedeem` → unwind → `pokeSettle` (repay Main debt, burn synth,
  withdraw collateral) → `claim` returns principal + compounded yield
- **harvest** → skim loop carry above cost basis → pro-rata split → compound into each
  vault's own collateral → share price rises; loop equity returns toward basis
- **rebalance** (both directions) → ETH appreciates → borrow more to the live max LTV → deploy
  the slack; ETH falls → de-lever the loop slice that restores the real-collateral ratio
- **maintainPeg** → Main debt accrues interest → re-top synthetic so `synth·LT ≥ debt`
- **multi-vault** → the shared loop correctly isolates and conserves equity/shares across
  concurrent vaults on different collateral assets (formally proved: share conservation +
  isolation, see `formal/README.md`)
- **audit remediation (bugs A–G)** — see `FUTURE_IMPROVEMENTS.md` for the full backlog and
  what's fixed on this branch vs. still open
- **Verity EVM-bridge feasibility spike** — verdict **GO (qualified)**; a real Propeller
  contract (`SyntheticToken`) compiles through the Lean→Yul pipeline and its mint/burn specs
  are machine-checked (`formal/BRIDGE_SPIKE.md`)

### External dependencies (see spec §7)
- **REQ-SWAP** — an `ISwapper` implementation backed by the Hydration Augustus
  (`IParaSwapAugustus`) routing to the Substrate router. Not yet deployed on mainnet; tests
  use a mock. Gating dependency for `compound`'s live swaps (the loop itself no longer needs
  it — HOLLAR↔aPRIME goes straight through `pallet_route::sell`).
- Synthetic reserve registration, PRIME ceiling /
  collateral supply-cap raises, deployer whitelist — all governance, shipped as an
  `aave-v3-deploy/tasks/proposals/propeller.ts` batch (mirrors `prime.ts` / `hdcl.ts`).
- **Main-vault HOLLAR discount**: `PropellerDiscount` and opt-in vault refresh hooks
  are implemented locally. The technical committee and governance can set 0-100%
  off Main interest; governance controls enrollment. SubLoop stays undiscounted.
  Installation is a separate governance batch, not part of `propeller.ts`.
  See [policy, deployment and tests](docs/main-borrow-discount.md).

### Open — not yet shipped
- **Independent human audit** — the in-repo review is AI-assisted and says so. Launch blocker.
- **End-to-end fork tests** — the discount suite exercises the deployed HOLLAR debt
  token, but collateral/router/withdrawal flows still need full fork coverage. Launch blocker.
- **REQ-DISCOUNT** — Main borrowing-interest discount implemented; not a redemption
  discount. Deployment, governance approval and discount-aware frontend integration
  remain pending. Neither the historical yield estimates nor a fixed APY are guaranteed.
- **PRIME mirror oracle** still owned by the looper hot key (fine for testnet; needs
  governance ownership + an updater role before mainnet).

### Deliberately not built
- **No admin emergency wind-down.** An earlier `adminUnwind()` force-unwound a live position
  out of its yield source, paused the vault, and de-risked everyone to bare collateral. It was
  removed: it locked non-redeeming holders behind a drain guard that realized slippage could
  make unsatisfiable, and that guard's tolerance scaled with position size rather than being
  true dust. To stop flow into a source now: `pause()` (guardian), then let holders redeem
  through the normal queue.
- **No in-place yield-source migration.** `setYieldSource` is a deploy-time wiring lever only —
  `DEAD_SHARES` keep `loopShares` permanently non-zero once a vault is funded, so the guard is
  unsatisfiable afterwards by construction. Changing a live vault's source means deploying a
  new vault.

Full backlog, dismissed false positives, and per-bug detail: `FUTURE_IMPROVEMENTS.md`.

## Build / test

```sh
forge build
forge test            # uses MockSwapper / MockPool / MockDispatch
forge test --fork-url $RPC_HYDRATION   # fork tests against live Aave + PRIME
```

Libs are reused from `../hdcl-vault/lib` (see `foundry.toml`).

Formal spec (Lean 4, separate Lake project, ignored by the Foundry build):
```sh
cd formal && . ~/.elan/env && lake build
```
See `formal/README.md` for the full theorem index.

## Future improvements (not in scope yet)

- **Flow matching / position hand-off (v2).** When a deposit and a withdrawal overlap, hand
  the exiting user's loop position directly to the entering user at NAV instead of delevering
  one and re-levering the other. Settle the exiter's equity from the enterer's incoming
  HOLLAR, transfer the loop equity shares, and only push the *net* imbalance through the
  unwind/deploy spiral. Saves both round-trips of swap cost and can make a matched withdrawal
  **instant**. In the share model this is just: match `min(pendingDeploy, pendingUnwind)` at
  `exchangeRate`, move shares exiter→enterer, skip both spirals for the matched amount.
  - **Cross-collateral matching (the nicest case).** Because the single loop is
    collateral-agnostic, an ETH-vault exit can be matched against a tBTC-vault entry by
    transferring the loop **shares** between vaults — loop position untouched. The enterer's
    freshly-borrowed HOLLAR repays the exiter's Main HOLLAR debt directly (HOLLAR→HOLLAR, no
    swap); each user keeps their own collateral asset; only the loop's funding source shifts
    ETH→tBTC. Saves both spiral round-trips *and* avoids any swap entirely.
- **Bounded harvest cadence**, estimated-wait views (HDCL `getEstimatedWaitTime` analogue),
  and an optional fast-path for small instant exits.
